# 🏡 Real Estate Mediator Web App

This is a lightweight web-based application for managing and viewing real estate listings — specifically **plots** and **buildings**. The system is divided into two parts:

- **Admin Panel (`admin.html`)** – Used to add, edit, and delete listings.
- **Public View (`index.html`)** – Used for mobile-friendly quick viewing with action buttons like contact, follow-up, mark sold, WhatsApp, and call.

## ✨ Features

- Add and manage **real estate listings** (owner name, address, location, rate, contact, image).
- Filter listings by **Plot** or **Building**.
- Track each listing with:
  - ✅ Mark as **Sold**
  - 📞 Mark as **Contacted**
  - 🔁 Add **Follow-up**
  - ♻️ Reset Follow-up count
  - 🔄 Reset Contacted
  - 🧹 Reset Sold
- Integrated buttons for:
  - 💬 **WhatsApp**
  - 📱 **Call**
- Responsive design for **mobile and desktop**.

## 💾 Data Storage

All data is stored in the browser's **localStorage**, so no backend is required.

## 📱 How to Use

1. Open `admin.html` on a laptop or desktop to add/edit listings.
2. Open `index.html` on mobile to view and interact with listings.
3. Use “Add to Home Screen” feature on mobile for quick access.

## 🎨 Tech Stack

- HTML, CSS (with gradient background and colorful UI)
- JavaScript (DOM manipulation + localStorage)

## 🛠️ Customization

You can enhance this by:
- Adding search/filter by location or owner name.
- Export/Import listings as JSON.
- Deploy on GitHub Pages or Netlify for access across devices.
